title: Is Release Planning needed in Scrum?
---
Release Planning is not essential in Scrum, furthermore not needing it
may actually be a positive sign of healthy product. Scrum aims to
deliver values continuously through short iterations, releases may
prevent this by delaying the delivery of value and customer feedback.

In the other side, Release Planning is still needed in many cases as it
is often difficult to deliver a complex business solution in a single
Sprint. Also it helps a team avoid finishing a series of sprints and
feeling that, while they always worked on the highest priority items,
the collection of work completed does not add up to a satisfying whole*.
In these cases, release planning is a valuable activity, a way to come
up with a plan, a road-map of what can be expected after a number of
sprints, and what will be part of the release and what wonâ€™t.
