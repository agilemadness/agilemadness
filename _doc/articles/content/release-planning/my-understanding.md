title: My Understanding

If you checked the [Scrum
Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf), you won't find anything related to
"Release Planning", but actually it was there one day. According to this
[article](https://www.scrum.org/resources/gone-are-release-planning-and-release-turndown) from Scrum.org, Any discussion about Release Planning and the
related Release Burndown chart have been removed from the 2011 Scrum
Guide. They decided in the recent updates to remove most of the tips and
strategies and only keep the basic rules by which Scrum has to be
played. Why? I'll quote there rational behind this decision below

> The previous version of the Scrum Guide described a lot about  What
> has to be done. However, describing the What closes the door on
> alternative and possibly better approaches. In contrast, describing
> the  Why prompts people to think for themselves about how to apply the
> concepts in their own unique context. Removing much of the  What from
> the Scrum Guide also prevents copy/paste behaviors, blindly following
> the rules, without understanding them, just because it happened to be
> successful in another situation;
