If you read the previous articles, you know now that neither Fahman nor
Ghaltan do it totally right, Ghaltan most of the time do it wrong and
Fahman tries to do it right. There is always a space for improvement for
both, besides I can't even claim that I know the absolute right
approach, that's why I'm sharing with you my understanding and waiting
for your comments to have a fruitful discussion.
