The amount of details written in user stories is a conflict point in
Scrum team. Let's see how Fahman & Ghaltan handle it

I do believe that neither Fahman nor Ghaltan do it right. I think you
were expecting to see Fahman doing everything right, I'm sorry for
disappointing you. I can't even claim that I know the absolute right
approach.

In Scrum, there is always a space for improvement that's why I'm sharing
with you my understanding and waiting for your comments to have a
fruitful discussion.
