title: Identifying Informal Leaders
---
There are several ways by which you can identify and recognize which of
your employees is a true leader. Observe group dynamics in formal and
informal gatherings. Who asserts themselves? To whom do people listen?
Look for the ones who usually are active participants in team meetings.
Notice who seems to get a lot of attention in both formal and informal
get-togethers. They’re the ones who don’t hesitate to share ideas and
information in team meetings and on the organization’s intranet. While
technically they are not required to do anything outside their job
descriptions, these informal leaders will often go far beyond the call
of duty.

True informal leaders are keenly tuned in to what’s happening in the
organization. And, since they keep people updated about what’s going on
in the workplace, their teammates will turn to them for facts and
opinions. Commonly, they will be asked to speak for the group when
necessary to interact with other departments or with higher-level
managers.
