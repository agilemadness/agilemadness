It’s important to understand the issue of loyalty when figuring out how
formal and informal leaders can work together. That’s because these two
types of people have different loyalties and the group has different
levels of loyalty to each of them. The formal leader’s loyalty is to the
organization or team whereas the informal leader’s is generally to the
group itself. (The informal leader may be self-involved but needs to
please the group to become a leader.) As a result of this, the loyalty
of the group tends to be with the informal leader rather than with the
formal leader even though the formal leader may be able to issue
consequences or provide rewards that the informal leader cannot.

Finally, try to find your informal leaders, Develop them, Appreciate
them, Benefit from them and Don’t ever think you can compete against
them!
