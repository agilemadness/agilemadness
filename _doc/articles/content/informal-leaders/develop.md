title: Developing and benefiting from Informal Leaders
---
Firstly, Remember that one of the elements that gives informal leaders
the ability to lead (and inspire) is their perceived independence from
the formal authority structure. Perception is very important. If you
want to develop informal leaders, the process needs to be subtle and
gradual and non-intrusive or the risk is that the informal leader will
lose his or her informal influence.

**Engage their partnership.** Involve your informal leaders at the
appropriate time – early-on if you have some latitude in how something
is conducted, or later in the timeline if the approach is locked-in.
This could be the initiation of a project, an organizational change, or
a potentially unpopular reallocation of resources, etc. As time and the
situation permits, get their inputs, hear their concerns, but also share
the factors you are weighing. With them inside the decision loop, they
will have a sense of ownership to be your advocate and support your
decisions.

**Utilise your early adopting informal leaders.** By involving your adopters
informal leaders in performance pilots or team developments, you are
entrusting them to be the first to experience and evaluate changes and
provide their insight into them. By doing so, you are fulfilling their
desire to be more involved with important decisions and development,
while also gaining a support system for the changes you are intending to
implement with a sturdy influencer behind it in your informal leader.

**Allow room for people to move beyond traditional boundaries.** You and
your informal leader will succeed if they are encouraged to create value
and build their own sense of ownership across the organisation. Work
with them to develop new projects and allow room for them to grow and
experiment with what is possible

**Consider promotion, but not as a given.** While it may seem that promoting
informal leaders to formal positions of power makes sense, recognize
that not all informal leaders want formal power and authority, and that
developing leadership skills in a systematic way may actually undermine
that person’s ability to lead informally. You have to ensure the
informal leader is consulted throughout the process about their genuine
career aspirations.
