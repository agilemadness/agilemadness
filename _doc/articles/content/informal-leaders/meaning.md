title: What does it mean?
---
Informal leaders are those who influence others without relying on their
title or formal position in the heirarchy to do so. They are so powerful
in spreading behaviors from the bottom up.

In another words, An informal leader is someone within an organization
who is perceived by his peers as worthy of paying attention to, or
following. Informal leader does NOT hold a position of power or formal
authority over those that choose to follow him or her.

Informal leaders have an uncanny ability to influence people and promote
change. They are often charismatic, distinctly loyal and influential.

Informal leaders don’t see themselves as special but do tend to see
themselves as being more responsible than others. Their coworkers look
up to them and they expect them to have answers.

Informal leaders sit in a sort of neutral, middle ground that makes them
accessible to anyone, as employees don’t think of them as management.
Management, on the other hand, tends to see them as something akin to
colleagues.
