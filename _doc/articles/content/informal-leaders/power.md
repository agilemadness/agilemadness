title: The Power of Informal Leaders
---
When informal leaders are working towards achieving the same vision and
goals as the formal leaders and the organization itself, they can take a
tremendous burden from the backs of managers and formal leaders.

they can also be huge impediments if they start pulling in directions
that are in opposition to the direction the formal leaders value. So
formal leaders may want to take steps to develop their informal leaders,
and keep lines of communication open with them.

Attempting to bribe, coerce or otherwise pressure an informal leader may
end up backfiring, as they mostly will “stand against” the formal
leader, because informal leader’s power and influence often derives from
the perception that he or she has integrity, and stands up for what he
or she believes.

One of the best examples that show the power of informal leader (early
adopters) comes from Derek Sivers’s TED talk, Please watch it it’s 3
minutes talk!

  The main takeaway from this talk is

  > Leadership is over glorified, the leader gets all the credit. but it was
  the first follower who transformed the lone nut into a leader. There is
  no movements without the first follower.

  Now let’s imagine that the first two followers didn’t like the movement
  and decided to face the leader with saracasm!, I think you can feel the
  power of informal leaders now.
