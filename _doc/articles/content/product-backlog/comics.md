title: Fahman vs Ghaltan
---

In this article I'm going to talk about the product backlog, If you have
missed the previous article about Amount of Details in User Story, you
can read it here.

Product backlog is one of the three artifacts of Scrum besides Sprint
backlog and Product Increment. Let's see how Fahman & Ghaltan handle it.

If you read the previous article, you know now that neither Fahman nor
Ghaltan do it totally right, Ghaltan most of the time do it wrong and
Fahman tries to do it right. There is always a space for improvement for
both, besides I can't even claim that I know the absolute right
approach, that's why I'm sharing with you my understanding and waiting
for your comments to have a fruitful discussion.
