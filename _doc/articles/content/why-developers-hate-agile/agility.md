title: Do they hate Agility or Agile?
---

At Agile Australia Conference this year, **[Martin
Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler)** - Coauthor of
Agile
Manifesto - has a talk entitled "[State of Agile in
2018](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/agile-2018)". the main point
of his talk was about the challenge we face as an Agile community right
now, he said

> Our challenge at the moment isn't making agile a thing that people
> want
to do, it's dealing with what I call faux-agile: agile that's just the
name, but none of the practices and values in place. **Ron Jeffries**
often
refers to it as "Dark Agile", or specifically "Dark Scrum". This is
actually even worse than just pretending to do agile, it's actively
using the name "agile" against the basic principles of what we were
trying to do, when we talked about doing this kind of work in the late
90s and at
Snowbird.[\*](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html)

He talked about 3 problems that face the community that we should fight
against, I'll mention below one of them which is related to the article
context

*  The lack of recognition of the importance of technical
excellence. He mentioned that A lot of agile conferences don't
tend to talk very much about the actual techniques of writing
software. which cause that agile conferences are now
attracting a lot of people who were involved in the project
management side and things of that kind, but not very many
people who are the technical people who actually did the work.
He think that even led to something worse which is developers
tried to make their own world away from business and project
managers and created the "[Software Craftsmanship
Movement](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/#/en) ".
Which is against the whole point of agile which is to combine
across all different areas.


However **[Robert C Martin (Uncle
Bob)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)** - Agile
Manifesto coauthor and author of Clean Code - disagree with
Fowler's opinion on the craftsmanship movement point in his
[blog
post](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/08/28/CraftsmanshipMovement.html)
as he is one of the supporters of this movement. But he agrees
with him in the whole point of view. He **(Uncle Bob)** talked about
the same idea years ago in his talk "[The Land that Scrum
Forgot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG4LH6P8Syk)". Mainly,
he believes that The Agile movement main goal was to "heal the divide
between programmers and management" as mentioned by
**[Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck)** in the Agile
Manifesto writing meeting years ago. The Agile movement abandoned it's
goal by
turning Agile into a business that promotes “new-and-better”
ways to manage. Instead of bringing managers and programmers
closer together, the Agile movement focussed almost entirely on
project management, and virtually excluded the programmers.


**[Dave
Tomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer))** - 
Agile Manifesto Coauthor - discussed the same idea too in his
talk "[Agile is
dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M)" at GOTO
conference 2015, after the success of his blog post "[Agile is
dead, Long live
Agility](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html)",
He
insisted - in his talk -  that Agile is an adjective not a noun
and they  use it as a noun just because you can't sell
"Adjectives". 



So the problem is not in the Agile itself, everyone will
acknowledge the Agile values and principles, but the real
problem is how we apply Agile? and how it has been sold as a
project management tool and ignoring the technical part that led
to excluding developers from the Agile community. In the three
talks, all of them mentioned terms like faux-agile, flaccid
scrum, dark agile and dark scrum. So I decided to dig deep in
these terms.
