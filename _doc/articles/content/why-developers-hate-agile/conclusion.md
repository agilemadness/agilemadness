There is a quote for **Uncle Bob** which say it all

> Scrum without technical practices becomes a tractor
pull. Every sprints it gets harder and harder and harder to make
progress, because the code is getting worse and worse.



So developers don't hate Agile, they hate what's called
faux-agile, they hate the wrong applying of Agile, they hate the
process without the technical practices that were made to make
their life easier.  This is the lesson we learned years ago but
We forget it everyday. 



By this article, I hope I helped myself, scrum masters and
developers to find what developers really hate about Agile, to
have a fruitful discussion helping us doing Agile right and
reach the aimed Agility. It's never been either process or
technical excellence, Both are always needed to make it right.
