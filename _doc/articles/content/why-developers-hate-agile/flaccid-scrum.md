title: Flaccid Scrum

**Martin Fowler** was the first to introduce this term in his
[article "Flaccid
Scrum"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html) back
to 2009. 

> There's a mess I've heard about with quite a few projects
recently. It works out like this:
*   They want to use an agile process, and pick Scrum
*   They adopt the Scrum practices, and maybe even the
principles
*   After a while progress is slow because the code base is a
mess

> What's happened is that they haven't paid enough attention to
the internal quality of their software. If you make that mistake
you'll soon find your productivity dragged down because it's
much harder to add new features than you'd like. You've taken on
a crippling Technical Debt and your scrum has gone weak at the
knees.
