**[Ron Jeffries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Jeffries)** -
coauthor of Agile Manifesto and coauthor of XP - introduced this
term in article entitled with the same title ["Dark
Scrum"](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/016-09ff/defense/), he
defined it as   

> Too often, at least in software, Scrum seems to oppress people.
Too often, Scrum does not deliver as rapidly, as reliably, as
steadily as it should. As a result, everyone suffers. Most
often, the developers suffer more than anyone.

He listed things that can go wrong in Scrum which lead to Dark
Scrum:

*   It takes time to get good at Scrum, Self-organization is slow to
    happen.
*   He used a term called Power holders, which means people who have and
    exert power over
developers whether by a development manager, a team lead, a Product
Owner, or even a Scrum Master. They can drive the team to Dark scrum by
    *   Power holder oppresses the team every day in "Daily Scrum".
    *   Power holders drive the team,  and tell them what they have to
        do because Business-side is not available in Sprint Planning or
not
trained in how to be a Product Owner.
    *   Power holders misuse the sprint reviewand sprint retrospective
    by making sure the programmers are made fully aware of how badly
theyâ€™ve done.
