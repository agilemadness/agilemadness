This week I was reading about “Change Management”, I came a cross the
term “Informal Leaders” and how they affect company change either
positively or negatively. I always believed that in any organization,
there are people who don’t need a formal position to have influence and
they can control the organization reaction to any decission, I was
extremely happy finding what support my old beliefs. In this article, I
copied the main takeaways from many articles to highlight the concept.
You can find list of references at the end of the article.
