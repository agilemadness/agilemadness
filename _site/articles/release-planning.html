According to this <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/gone-are-release-planning-and-release-turndown">article</a> from Scrum.org, Any discussion about Release Planning and the related Release Burndown chart have been removed from the 2011 Scrum Guide. They decided in the recent updates to remove most of the tips and strategies and only keep the basic rules by which Scrum has to be played. Why? I’ll quote there rational behind this decision below</p> <blockquote> <p>The previous version of the Scrum Guide described a lot about What has to be done. However, describing the What closes the door on alternative and possibly better approaches. In contrast, describing the Why prompts people to think for themselves about how to apply the concepts in their own unique context. Removing much of the What from the Scrum Guide also prevents copy/paste behaviors, blindly following the rules, without understanding them, just because it happened to be successful in another situation;</p> </blockquote> </div> </section> <section id="is-release-planning-needed-in-scrum" class="doc-section"> <h2 class="section-title">Is Release Planning needed in Scrum?</h2> <div class="section-block"> <p>Release Planning is not essential in Scrum, furthermore not needing it may actually be a positive sign of healthy product. Scrum aims to deliver values continuously through short iterations, releases may prevent this by delaying the delivery of value and customer feedback.</p> <p>In the other side, Release Planning is still needed in many cases as it is often difficult to deliver a complex business solution in a single Sprint. Also it helps a team avoid finishing a series of sprints and feeling that, while they always worked on the highest priority items, the collection of work completed does not add up to a satisfying whole*. In these cases, release planning is a valuable activity, a way to come up with a plan, a road-map of what can be expected after a number of sprints, and what will be part of the release and what won’t.</p> </div> </section> <section id="what-needs-to-be-done-in-release-planning" class="doc-section"> <h2 class="section-title">What needs to be done in Release Planning?</h2> <div class="section-block"> <p>Mainly in release planning you will need to define the scope and estimate how long will it take.</p> <h3 id="defining-scope-user-story-mapping">Defining Scope User Story Mapping</h3> <p>For defining the scope I really like the User Story Mapping approach, it may be used for planning multiple releases too.</p> <p><a href="https://jpattonassociates.com/user-story-mapping/">User story mapping</a> is a technique introduced by Jeff Patton, It’s a way to replace traditional flat backlog. One of its objective is to collect requirement collaboratively by enabling all participants from creating backlog on a wall.</p> <p>Story map structure is <strong>Activities</strong> &gt; <strong>Tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Stories</strong>, and it may look like the following board.</p> <p>Activities should show from left to right a complete user journey, Stories should be ordered top-down by priority. each horizontal swim lane shows a release.</p> <p><img style="width:100%" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQGbh-VkGq6WRw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1562803200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=BruJpeEpzZyrXOj7dIPWm2QzTUytYfCS9WkilMM_V58" /></p> <h3 id="estimation-user-story-sizing">Estimation User Story Sizing</h3> <p>The most famous approach for estimating group of product backlog items is relative sizing, which is concerned by the relative value instead of the absolute value of the PBI. Imagine PBI sized like T-Shirts Small, Medium, Large, X-Large..etc. this is good to show the relativity idea but it won’t be easy to say “we have 10 Large &amp; 20 Small PBIs, how long will it take?”</p> <p>That leads us to <strong>story point sizing</strong>, Story points are a measure for expressing estimated effort to finish PBI, the available values are derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1,2,3,5,8,13 to express the relativity. When you have a backlog with total 100 story points, If you knew that the team able to finish 20 points in one sprint. Then you can easily have an estimated time to finish the whole backlog after 5 sprints.</p> <p>A FAQ here why story points? Why not time like the usual man-hour or man-day? In Scrum besides “The Increment”, there are 2 more artifacts “Sprint Backlog” &amp; “Product Backlog” both need to be estimated in different times with different amount of available information.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Product Backlog</strong>: Estimates needed in release planning or once a new PBI is available to define priorities and basic schedule. Only abstract information are available.</li> <li><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: Estimates needed in sprint planning when detailed information are available That’s why it’s preferred to measure both backlogs in different units, Sprint backlog in hours and product backlog in points, Mike Cohn write a very detailed <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/sprint-and-release-planning-should-be-in-different-units">article</a> answering this question.</li> </ul> <p>There are many techniques that could be used to estimate your backlog by story points. The most common techniques is <strong>“The Planning Poker”</strong>, but there are some other useful techniques like <strong>“Relative Sizing Grid”</strong> and <strong>“Crumb Scale”</strong>.</p> <p><strong>The Planning Poker</strong> is a consensus-based estimating technique. to start a poker planning session, the product owner describes user story to the team. Each member is holding a deck of Planning Poker cards with values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ..etc. When the feature has been fully discussed, each member privately selects one card to represent his estimate. All cards are then revealed at the same time. If all members agree on the same value, that becomes the estimate. If not, The high and low estimators should share their reasons. Then the whole team reselects an estimate card and the process is repeated until consensus is achieved.*</p> <p>As planning poker relies on relative sizing, the main challenge that face the team is estimating the first item in the backlog or setting the baseline that will be followed in the rest of the estimation process. My recommendation is the team selects 3 stories with values 1, 3 and 8 without using planning poker just through the discussion, then the team use planning poker to estimate the rest relatively to the chosen stories. Mike Cohn recommending almost a similar idea in this <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-best-way-to-establish-a-baseline-when-playing-planning-poker">article</a>.</p> <p>Based on my experience planning poker is not that easy for teams that are new to the relative sizing concept, that’s why I recommend either “Relative Sizing Grid” or “Crumb Scale” for teams new to the concept.</p> <p><strong>Relative sizing grid</strong> <a href="https://www.excella.com/insights/sizing-agile-stories-with-the-relative-sizing-grid">*</a> session starts by having a 2-axis grid for risk and effort, team starts to put stories in the suitable position relatively to each other, then reveal the boundaries to determine story sizes.</p> <p><img style="width:100%" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQED4D5lZsJIow/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1562803200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=FDILja1gcX_eaC7d2g2_l9-9yylT5Q9DblalBUMKrNo" /></p> <p><strong>CrumbScale</strong> <a href="https://rallypointbacklog.squarespace.com/crumbscale/">*</a> session starts by dropping stories one by one ordered in a new list, just like “Insertion Sort”. Then starting at the smallest and give it <strong>1</strong>, then when you find a story twice as big as it’s previous one give it <strong>2</strong> and so on.</p> <p>I hope this was helpful. I’d like to talk about “Consensus Games” in more details <strong>but that’s another article!</strong></p> </div> </section> </div> </div> <!-- SIDEBAR --> <div class="doc-sidebar"> <nav id="doc-nav"> <ul id="doc-menu" class="nav doc-menu hidden-xs" data-spy="affix"> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#fahman-vs-ghaltan">Fahman vs Ghaltan</a></li> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#my-understanding">My Understanding</a></li> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#is-release-planning-needed-in-scrum">Is Release Planning needed in Scrum?</a></li> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#what-needs-to-be-done-in-release-planning">What needs to be done in Release Planning?</a></li> <ul class="nav doc-sub-menu"> <li class=""><a class="scrollto" href="#defining-scope-user-story-mapping">Defining Scope User Story Mapping</a></li> <li class=""><a class="scrollto" href="#estimation-user-story-sizing">Estimation User Story Sizing</a></li> </ul> </ul> </nav> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="footer text-center"> <div class="container"> <!--/* This template is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.
