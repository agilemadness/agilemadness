Kind of - I think - some say it clearly, some are not convinced, some see it’s important but not as important as technicality.</p> <p>As an Agile fan, I always think that Agile is a must have, it’s an intuitive idea, Why can anyone hate it?! I have never been able to understand those who resist Agile transformation or adoption. Recently I started to read more from the other perspective trying to understand what they feel, fear and want? I’ll share in this article my finding on the answer of this question.</p> <!-- SECTIONS --> <section id="do-they-hate-agility-or-agile" class="doc-section"> <h2 class="section-title">Do they hate Agility or Agile?</h2> <div class="section-block"> <p>At Agile Australia Conference this year, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler">Martin Fowler</a></strong> - Coauthor of Agile Manifesto - has a talk entitled “<a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/agile-2018">State of Agile in 2018</a>”. the main point of his talk was about the challenge we face as an Agile community right now, he said</p> <blockquote> <p>Our challenge at the moment isn’t making agile a thing that people want to do, it’s dealing with what I call faux-agile: agile that’s just the name, but none of the practices and values in place. <strong>Ron Jeffries</strong> often refers to it as “Dark Agile”, or specifically “Dark Scrum”. This is actually even worse than just pretending to do agile, it’s actively using the name “agile” against the basic principles of what we were trying to do, when we talked about doing this kind of work in the late 90s and at Snowbird.<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html">*</a></p> </blockquote> <p>He talked about 3 problems that face the community that we should fight against, I’ll mention below one of them which is related to the article context</p> <ul> <li>The lack of recognition of the importance of technical excellence. He mentioned that A lot of agile conferences don’t tend to talk very much about the actual techniques of writing software. which cause that agile conferences are now attracting a lot of people who were involved in the project management side and things of that kind, but not very many people who are the technical people who actually did the work. He think that even led to something worse which is developers tried to make their own world away from business and project managers and created the “<a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/#/en">Software Craftsmanship Movement</a> “. Which is against the whole point of agile which is to combine across all different areas.</li> </ul> <p>However <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob)</a></strong> - Agile Manifesto coauthor and author of Clean Code - disagree with Fowler’s opinion on the craftsmanship movement point in his <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/08/28/CraftsmanshipMovement.html">blog post</a> as he is one of the supporters of this movement. But he agrees with him in the whole point of view. He <strong>(Uncle Bob)</strong> talked about the same idea years ago in his talk “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG4LH6P8Syk">The Land that Scrum Forgot</a>”. Mainly, he believes that The Agile movement main goal was to “heal the divide between programmers and management” as mentioned by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a></strong> in the Agile Manifesto writing meeting years ago. The Agile movement abandoned it’s goal by turning Agile into a business that promotes “new-and-better” ways to manage. Instead of bringing managers and programmers closer together, the Agile movement focussed almost entirely on project management, and virtually excluded the programmers.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer)">Dave Tomas</a></strong> - Agile Manifesto Coauthor - discussed the same idea too in his talk “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M">Agile is dead</a>” at GOTO conference 2015, after the success of his blog post “<a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html">Agile is dead, Long live Agility</a>”, He insisted - in his talk - that Agile is an adjective not a noun and they use it as a noun just because you can’t sell “Adjectives”.</p> <p>So the problem is not in the Agile itself, everyone will acknowledge the Agile values and principles, but the real problem is how we apply Agile? and how it has been sold as a project management tool and ignoring the technical part that led to excluding developers from the Agile community. In the three talks, all of them mentioned terms like faux-agile, flaccid scrum, dark agile and dark scrum. So I decided to dig deep in these terms.</p> </div> </section> <section id="flaccid-scrum" class="doc-section"> <h2 class="section-title">Flaccid Scrum</h2> <div class="section-block"> <p><strong>Martin Fowler</strong> was the first to introduce this term in his <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html">article “Flaccid Scrum”</a> back to 2009.</p> <blockquote> <p>There’s a mess I’ve heard about with quite a few projects recently. It works out like this:</p> <ul> <li>They want to use an agile process, and pick Scrum</li> <li>They adopt the Scrum practices, and maybe even the principles</li> <li>After a while progress is slow because the code base is a mess</li> </ul> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>What’s happened is that they haven’t paid enough attention to the internal quality of their software. If you make that mistake you’ll soon find your productivity dragged down because it’s much harder to add new features than you’d like. You’ve taken on a crippling Technical Debt and your scrum has gone weak at the knees.</p> </blockquote> </div> </section> <section id="dark-scrum" class="doc-section"> <h2 class="section-title">Dark Scrum</h2> <div class="section-block"> <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Jeffries">Ron Jeffries</a></strong> - coauthor of Agile Manifesto and coauthor of XP - introduced this term in article entitled with the same title <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/016-09ff/defense/">“Dark Scrum”</a>, he defined it as</p> <blockquote> <p>Too often, at least in software, Scrum seems to oppress people. Too often, Scrum does not deliver as rapidly, as reliably, as steadily as it should. As a result, everyone suffers. Most often, the developers suffer more than anyone.</p> </blockquote> <p>He listed things that can go wrong in Scrum which lead to Dark Scrum:</p> <ul> <li>It takes time to get good at Scrum, Self-organization is slow to happen.</li> <li>He used a term called Power holders, which means people who have and exert power over developers whether by a development manager, a team lead, a Product Owner, or even a Scrum Master. They can drive the team to Dark scrum by <ul> <li>Power holder oppresses the team every day in “Daily Scrum”.</li> <li>Power holders drive the team, and tell them what they have to do because Business-side is not available in Sprint Planning or not trained in how to be a Product Owner.</li> <li>Power holders misuse the sprint reviewand sprint retrospective by making sure the programmers are made fully aware of how badly they’ve done.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </section> <section id="scrum" class="doc-section"> <h2 class="section-title">Scrum</h2> <div class="section-block"> <p>I’ll need to clarify that this is not a problem in Scrum itself, Scrum doesn’t tell us to ignore technical practices, <strong>Martin Fowler</strong> defended Scrum in the same article “Flaccid Scrum”</p> <blockquote> <p>I’ve mentioned Scrum because when we see this problem, Scrum seems to be particularly common as the nominative process the team is following.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>In defense of Scrum, it’s important to point out that just because it doesn’t include technical activities within its scope should not lead anyone to conclude that it doesn’t think they are important. Whenever I’ve listened to prominent Scrummers they’ve always emphasized that you must have good technical practices to succeed with a Scrum project. They don’t mandate what those technical practices should be, but you do need them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Also <strong>Ron Jeffries</strong> mentioned that Scrum is actually trying to change all what he described as Dark Scrum. But until the hearts and minds of the organization actually change, there’ll be too much of the old-style management happening … and now it happens every couple of weeks … often every single day!</p> <p>Furthermore <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Schwaber">Ken Shwaber</a></strong> - Coauthor of Scrum and Agile Manifesto - agrees Martin Fowler on “Flaccid Scrum”. If you’d like to see the creator of Scrum “inspect and adapt”, please check his <a href="https://www.scrum.org/index.php/about">letter</a> in why he created “Scrum.org”. It’s kind of retrospective, Scrum Guide itself and PSM certificate were action items to fight “Flaccid Scrum”.</p> </div> </section> <section id="how-to-overcome-faux-agile-flaccid-scrum-dark-scrum" class="doc-section"> <h2 class="section-title">How to overcome Faux-agile/Flaccid Scrum/Dark Scrum?</h2> <div class="section-block"> <p>As you might notice, all the references in this article are coauthors of the Agile Manifesto, and the most important most of them are Extreme Programming gurus - Developers in the first place, So I think you won’t be surprised If I told you that they think the solution of all these issues by adopting XP practices. and I think they are totally right. XP are the only Agile methodology that advice and tells how to do it, I believe it’s the only methodology made by developers to make their life better.</p> <p><strong>Ron Jeffries</strong> in his article Dark Scrum mentioned some practices that could help Scrum teams do it right and avoid Dark Scrum, here it follow</p> <ul> <li> <p>Refactoring (Incremental Design)</p> <ul> <li> <p>In a Scrum project, we’re supposed to deliver a tested, working, potentially shippable Product Increment after each Sprint. Obviously, we can’t have the whole design figured out at the beginning: we only know roughly what the product will even be. Equally obviously, we need to wind up with a good design at the end. Therefore, the design of our software must be created incrementally, a bit at a time.</p> </li> <li> <p>if we are going to deliver a Product Increment every Sprint, we must find a way to do good design, incrementally.</p> </li> <li> <p>The best way we know today to do incremental design is called “Refactoring”. Refactoring is the process of improving the design of existing code — without breaking it!</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Automated Acceptance Test</p> <ul> <li> <p>PO and the developers to agree on concrete, executable acceptance tests for each story.</p> </li> <li> <p>When we automate these examples, we can run all of them and show with certainty that the product is still doing what we agreed it should do.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>TDD</p> <ul> <li> <p>It’s very helpful to have a lot of little tests supporting each larger acceptance test, because the little tests tell us which bit we got wrong, while the acceptance test just screams “Something Broke!”</p> </li> <li> <p>These tests also help us with larger refactorings.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Continuous Integration</p> <ul> <li>An automated build process, running the system’s test suite, turns out to be an essential part of a Scrum team’s development process. For most teams, the more frequently they build, the better things go. Building “all the time” seems to go best</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </section> <section id="conclusion" class="doc-section"> <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2> <div class="section-block"> <p>There is a quote for <strong>Uncle Bob</strong> which say it all</p> <blockquote> <p>Scrum without technical practices becomes a tractor pull. Every sprints it gets harder and harder and harder to make progress, because the code is getting worse and worse.</p> </blockquote> <p>So developers don’t hate Agile, they hate what’s called faux-agile, they hate the wrong applying of Agile, they hate the process without the technical practices that were made to make their life easier. This is the lesson we learned years ago but We forget it everyday.</p> <p>By this article, I hope I helped myself, scrum masters and developers to find what developers really hate about Agile, to have a fruitful discussion helping us doing Agile right and reach the aimed Agility. It’s never been either process or technical excellence, Both are always needed to make it right.</p> </div> </section> </div> </div> <!-- SIDEBAR --> <div class="doc-sidebar"> <nav id="doc-nav"> <ul id="doc-menu" class="nav doc-menu hidden-xs" data-spy="affix"> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#do-they-hate-agility-or-agile">Do they hate Agility or Agile?</a></li> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#flaccid-scrum">Flaccid Scrum</a></li> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#dark-scrum">Dark Scrum</a></li> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#scrum">Scrum</a></li> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#how-to-overcome-faux-agile-flaccid-scrum-dark-scrum">How to overcome Faux-agile/Flaccid Scrum/Dark Scrum?</a></li> <li><a class="scrollto" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li> </ul> </nav> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="footer text-center"> <div class="container"> <!--/* This template is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.
