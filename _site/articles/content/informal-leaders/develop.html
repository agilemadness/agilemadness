Perception is very important. If you want to develop informal leaders, the process needs to be subtle and gradual and non-intrusive or the risk is that the informal leader will lose his or her informal influence.</p> <p><strong>Engage their partnership.</strong> Involve your informal leaders at the appropriate time – early-on if you have some latitude in how something is conducted, or later in the timeline if the approach is locked-in. This could be the initiation of a project, an organizational change, or a potentially unpopular reallocation of resources, etc. As time and the situation permits, get their inputs, hear their concerns, but also share the factors you are weighing. With them inside the decision loop, they will have a sense of ownership to be your advocate and support your decisions.</p> <p><strong>Utilise your early adopting informal leaders.</strong> By involving your adopters informal leaders in performance pilots or team developments, you are entrusting them to be the first to experience and evaluate changes and provide their insight into them. By doing so, you are fulfilling their desire to be more involved with important decisions and development, while also gaining a support system for the changes you are intending to implement with a sturdy influencer behind it in your informal leader.</p> <p><strong>Allow room for people to move beyond traditional boundaries.</strong> You and your informal leader will succeed if they are encouraged to create value and build their own sense of ownership across the organisation. Work with them to develop new projects and allow room for them to grow and experiment with what is possible</p> <p><strong>Consider promotion, but not as a given.</strong> While it may seem that promoting informal leaders to formal positions of power makes sense, recognize that not all informal leaders want formal power and authority, and that developing leadership skills in a systematic way may actually undermine that person’s ability to lead informally. You have to ensure the informal leader is consulted throughout the process about their genuine career aspirations.</p> <!-- SECTIONS --> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="footer text-center"> <div class="container"> <!--/* This template is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.
