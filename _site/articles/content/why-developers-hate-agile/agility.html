This is actually even worse than just pretending to do agile, it’s actively using the name “agile” against the basic principles of what we were trying to do, when we talked about doing this kind of work in the late 90s and at Snowbird.<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html">*</a></p> </blockquote> <p>He talked about 3 problems that face the community that we should fight against, I’ll mention below one of them which is related to the article context</p> <ul> <li>The lack of recognition of the importance of technical excellence. He mentioned that A lot of agile conferences don’t tend to talk very much about the actual techniques of writing software. which cause that agile conferences are now attracting a lot of people who were involved in the project management side and things of that kind, but not very many people who are the technical people who actually did the work. He think that even led to something worse which is developers tried to make their own world away from business and project managers and created the “<a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/#/en">Software Craftsmanship Movement</a> “. Which is against the whole point of agile which is to combine across all different areas.</li> </ul> <p>However <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob)</a></strong> - Agile Manifesto coauthor and author of Clean Code - disagree with Fowler’s opinion on the craftsmanship movement point in his <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/08/28/CraftsmanshipMovement.html">blog post</a> as he is one of the supporters of this movement. But he agrees with him in the whole point of view. He <strong>(Uncle Bob)</strong> talked about the same idea years ago in his talk “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG4LH6P8Syk">The Land that Scrum Forgot</a>”. Mainly, he believes that The Agile movement main goal was to “heal the divide between programmers and management” as mentioned by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a></strong> in the Agile Manifesto writing meeting years ago. The Agile movement abandoned it’s goal by turning Agile into a business that promotes “new-and-better” ways to manage. Instead of bringing managers and programmers closer together, the Agile movement focussed almost entirely on project management, and virtually excluded the programmers.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer)">Dave Tomas</a></strong> - Agile Manifesto Coauthor - discussed the same idea too in his talk “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M">Agile is dead</a>” at GOTO conference 2015, after the success of his blog post “<a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html">Agile is dead, Long live Agility</a>”, He insisted - in his talk - that Agile is an adjective not a noun and they use it as a noun just because you can’t sell “Adjectives”.</p> <p>So the problem is not in the Agile itself, everyone will acknowledge the Agile values and principles, but the real problem is how we apply Agile? and how it has been sold as a project management tool and ignoring the technical part that led to excluding developers from the Agile community. In the three talks, all of them mentioned terms like faux-agile, flaccid scrum, dark agile and dark scrum. So I decided to dig deep in these terms.</p> <!-- SECTIONS --> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="footer text-center"> <div class="container"> <!--/* This template is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.
