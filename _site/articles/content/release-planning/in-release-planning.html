One of its objective is to collect requirement collaboratively by enabling all participants from creating backlog on a wall.</p> <p>Story map structure is <strong>Activities</strong> &gt; <strong>Tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Stories</strong>, and it may look like the following board.</p> <p>Activities should show from left to right a complete user journey, Stories should be ordered top-down by priority. each horizontal swim lane shows a release.</p> <p><img style="width:100%" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQGbh-VkGq6WRw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1562803200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=BruJpeEpzZyrXOj7dIPWm2QzTUytYfCS9WkilMM_V58" /></p> <h3 id="estimation-user-story-sizing">Estimation User Story Sizing</h3> <p>The most famous approach for estimating group of product backlog items is relative sizing, which is concerned by the relative value instead of the absolute value of the PBI. Imagine PBI sized like T-Shirts Small, Medium, Large, X-Large..etc. this is good to show the relativity idea but it won’t be easy to say “we have 10 Large &amp; 20 Small PBIs, how long will it take?”</p> <p>That leads us to <strong>story point sizing</strong>, Story points are a measure for expressing estimated effort to finish PBI, the available values are derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1,2,3,5,8,13 to express the relativity. When you have a backlog with total 100 story points, If you knew that the team able to finish 20 points in one sprint. Then you can easily have an estimated time to finish the whole backlog after 5 sprints.</p> <p>A FAQ here why story points? Why not time like the usual man-hour or man-day? In Scrum besides “The Increment”, there are 2 more artifacts “Sprint Backlog” &amp; “Product Backlog” both need to be estimated in different times with different amount of available information.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Product Backlog</strong>: Estimates needed in release planning or once a new PBI is available to define priorities and basic schedule. Only abstract information are available.</li> <li><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: Estimates needed in sprint planning when detailed information are available That’s why it’s preferred to measure both backlogs in different units, Sprint backlog in hours and product backlog in points, Mike Cohn write a very detailed <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/sprint-and-release-planning-should-be-in-different-units">article</a> answering this question.</li> </ul> <p>There are many techniques that could be used to estimate your backlog by story points. The most common techniques is <strong>“The Planning Poker”</strong>, but there are some other useful techniques like <strong>“Relative Sizing Grid”</strong> and <strong>“Crumb Scale”</strong>.</p> <p><strong>The Planning Poker</strong> is a consensus-based estimating technique. to start a poker planning session, the product owner describes user story to the team. Each member is holding a deck of Planning Poker cards with values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ..etc. When the feature has been fully discussed, each member privately selects one card to represent his estimate. All cards are then revealed at the same time. If all members agree on the same value, that becomes the estimate. If not, The high and low estimators should share their reasons. Then the whole team reselects an estimate card and the process is repeated until consensus is achieved.*</p> <p>As planning poker relies on relative sizing, the main challenge that face the team is estimating the first item in the backlog or setting the baseline that will be followed in the rest of the estimation process. My recommendation is the team selects 3 stories with values 1, 3 and 8 without using planning poker just through the discussion, then the team use planning poker to estimate the rest relatively to the chosen stories. Mike Cohn recommending almost a similar idea in this <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-best-way-to-establish-a-baseline-when-playing-planning-poker">article</a>.</p> <p>Based on my experience planning poker is not that easy for teams that are new to the relative sizing concept, that’s why I recommend either “Relative Sizing Grid” or “Crumb Scale” for teams new to the concept.</p> <p><strong>Relative sizing grid</strong> <a href="https://www.excella.com/insights/sizing-agile-stories-with-the-relative-sizing-grid">*</a> session starts by having a 2-axis grid for risk and effort, team starts to put stories in the suitable position relatively to each other, then reveal the boundaries to determine story sizes.</p> <p><img style="width:100%" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQED4D5lZsJIow/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1562803200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=FDILja1gcX_eaC7d2g2_l9-9yylT5Q9DblalBUMKrNo" /></p> <p><strong>CrumbScale</strong> <a href="https://rallypointbacklog.squarespace.com/crumbscale/">*</a> session starts by dropping stories one by one ordered in a new list, just like “Insertion Sort”. Then starting at the smallest and give it <strong>1</strong>, then when you find a story twice as big as it’s previous one give it <strong>2</strong> and so on.</p> <p>I hope this was helpful. I’d like to talk about “Consensus Games” in more details <strong>but that’s another article!</strong></p> <!-- SECTIONS --> </div> </div> <!-- SIDEBAR --> <div class="doc-sidebar"> <nav id="doc-nav"> <ul id="doc-menu" class="nav doc-menu hidden-xs" data-spy="affix"> </ul> </nav> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="footer text-center"> <div class="container"> <!--/* This template is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.
